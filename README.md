# Team Profile Generator
  
  ## Description
  
  This app is created for generating employee profiles for a team. The application uses inquirer package to prompt for user input such as name, email id, emp id, school, github username, role, office number etc. to generate the team profile. After getting the user input, the application will generate a HTML file that from the command line displays the employee data in a professional way. I used the following technologies in this assignment. Node.js (inquirer and Jest), JavaScript, ES6, HTML, CSS, md bootstrap.
